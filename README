Many of the programs will be written in Fortran 2003, and built/compiled
using my custom python tool to build Fortran projects effortlessly. This tool
automatically determines dependencies and writes them to a file that can be
included into a Makefile. It also includes an easy way to define new
namelist parameters using a simple template file that is parsed/compiled into
usable Fortran code at build time.
