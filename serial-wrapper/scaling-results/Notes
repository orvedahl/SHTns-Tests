Various scaling data for init_type=mag_init_type=1, max_iterations=50

Interactive/
	these runs were computed with an interactive session:
		-request 1024 cores
		-run all problem sizes and core counts = (16,32,...,512,1024)
		 using a bash script to avoid wasting time

Together/
	these runs were computed with separate compute-job sessions:
		-request 512 cores
		-run all problem sizes and core counts = (16,32,...,256,512)

Separate/
	these runs all requested their own separate compute-job sessions:
		-each core count had its own jobscript
			-jobscript_16.sh
			-jobscript_32.sh
			...
			-jobscript_512.sh
			-jobscript_1024.sh
		-each jobscript ran all problem sizes at the given core count
