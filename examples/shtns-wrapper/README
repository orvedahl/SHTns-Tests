This is a first pass at reproducing the data layout in Rayleigh and still calling
the Legendre transform from SHTns.

I tried to reproduce the module layout with ProblemSize & Legendre_Polynomials, then
rewrote Legendre_Transforms to use SHTns.

As a result, it is very kludgy in where things are stored/intialized.

But it works as a proof-of-concept...I guess
